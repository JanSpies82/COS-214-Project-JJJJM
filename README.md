## Description of how to run the code: 
First you will need to download the git repository into a local folder on your device. You will then run the command `cmake CMakeLists.txt` with a terminal set to the
src folder location. Then run the same command while in the test folder location. If you wish to run the unit tests then run the command `make` while in the test folder
followed by the command `./test`. If you wish to run the actual program then run the command `make` in the src folder followed by `./main`. At this point you will be
prompted for console input to start the simulation.
